The notifier alerts deals that the 'host' account has favourited. The host account needs to favourite the deals that the notifer wants to be alerted or else nothing will display - there is an option in the base API to use lat/lon to find all deals in x area, which can be explained more in-depth [here](https://github.com/ahivert/tgtg-python)
